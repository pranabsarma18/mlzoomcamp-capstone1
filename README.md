## Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the classification of corn (maize) plant leaf diseases. The dataset consists of images categorized into four classes: Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, Blight, and Healthy. The goal is to train a robust classification model that can accurately identify the specific disease affecting a corn plant based on images of its leaves.

## Dataset:
The dataset comprises a total of 4188 images, distributed across the following classes:

* Common Rust: 1306 images
* Gray Leaf Spot: 574 images
* Blight: 1146 images
* Healthy: 1162 images
The images have been pre-labeled with their respective disease classes to facilitate supervised learning.

## Problem Statement:
Corn is a staple crop worldwide and is susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact yield and quality. Early detection and accurate classification of plant diseases are crucial for implementing timely interventions such as targeted treatment or removal of infected plants. Traditional methods of disease diagnosis can be time-consuming and may not scale well to large agricultural settings.

Deep learning models offer a promising solution for automating the classification process. By training a neural network on a diverse dataset of corn leaf images, the model can learn to recognize patterns and features indicative of different diseases. The ultimate goal is to deploy the trained model as part of an intelligent system that can assist farmers and agricultural experts in identifying and managing plant diseases effectively.

## Approach:
The project follows a deep learning approach to address the classification task. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), known for their effectiveness in image classification tasks, will be employed to learn hierarchical representations from the input images. Transfer learning may also be explored, leveraging pre-trained models such as those from the TensorFlow or PyTorch model zoos.

Key steps in the approach include:

## Data Preprocessing:

Loading and organizing the dataset.
Augmenting the data to increase model robustness.
Model Training:

Building and training a deep learning model.
Experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation:

Assessing the model's performance on a separate test set.
Analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deployment (Future Consideration):

Preparing the model for deployment in real-world scenarios.
Exploring options for integration into agricultural systems.
